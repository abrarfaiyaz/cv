[Ocean Deep] 

How deep is the sigh
	that comes out of the blue;
That distracts, 
	and desires the best of you?

How deep is the sigh 
	that leaves no clue;
With the struggles every day,
	that you have to go through?

How deep is the sigh 
	that empties your heart;
You are relieved the day ends;
	Wait.. the night is yet to start.

How deep is the sigh 
	that makes you all numb?
When you embrace for impact,
	everything feels dumb.

The ocean is the deep
	You’ll sink so slow.
The rays keep breaking,
	dancing with the flow.

The ocean is the deep
	Time stops, and sigh
“Would it be so wrong, 
	if I was allowed to die?”

The ocean loves you deeply
 		I know its hard,
If you wish to survive,
		play your highest card.
