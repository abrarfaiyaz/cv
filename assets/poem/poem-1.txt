[A Melting Heart]

What's love but a melting heart...
with so much bruise, 
      do you get a restart?

With the aching sharp edges
I have carved my stone,
I have built my spaceship,
      left the ground, all-alone.

The feelings? its buried... 
no one’s figuring that out!
Under the prayer-rug, in Sujuds…
      I'll let the greens sprout.

Can the green win…
the dune and dust?
It might,
      but surely not fast!

May be water and shine…
      will take their turn.
And may be the green will last
And may be the earth breaths and yearn.
No metaphors,
I want peace that's all
I am okay,
I can surely make that call.

I’ll land one day,
flying space and time.
Every breath will hymn ease,
      every dawn, a rhyme.

I’ll ask again
What is love but a melting heart...
May be…just may be then …
      I won’t need a restart.
