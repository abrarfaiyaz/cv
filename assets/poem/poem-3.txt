[Ocean Deep in Quiet Flames]

The ocean calls with a silent plea
A mirror deep 
        where dreams run free.
It whispers secrets 
        I cant unsee
Casting shadows that anchor me

How deep the sigh 
      from waters wide
Where restless waves 
      and fears collide
It tears apart what's help inside
The ebb and flow we cannot hide

Ocean Deep, 
it drowns my name...
Pulls me in 
      with quiet flame
A siren's cry,
        I can't reclaim
Lost in tides I'll never tame

Blue Horizons stretch unbound
Where treasures sink
        that can't be found
I dive through echoes without a sound
A searching heart where I am drowned

Longing sails on currents dark
A compass lost without a spark
Tracing stars through every mark
But the endless sea just leaves its arc.

Ocean Deep, 
it drowns my name...
Pulls me in 
      with quiet flame
A siren's cry,
        I can't reclaim
Lost in tides I'll never tame
